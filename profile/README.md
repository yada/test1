## ✨ Welcome

Welcome to [Microcks](https://microcks.io/), the Open-Source [(OSS)](https://opensource.org/) [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) Native tool for API Mocking and Testing.

As numerous API styles and protocols coexist, requiring the need for a uniform way to accelerate and secure their delivery! Our objective is to establish Microcks as the de-facto standard tool for delivering this unified approach [the Open-Source way](https://www.theopensourceway.org/) 🙌

> 💡 **From day one, Microcks had the vision of a multi-protocol API ecosystem due to the ubiquitous nature of API. This is especially true at the enterprise level where the technology strata are built over the years.**

The most important aspect is testing your APIs consistently using [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/), [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/), and [Postman Collections](https://www.postman.com/collection/) across web, [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), [WebSockets](https://websockets.spec.whatwg.org/#the-websocket-interface), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), [NATS](https://nats.io/), Google [PubSub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview?hl=en) and other popular patterns and protocols of your API lifecycle.
